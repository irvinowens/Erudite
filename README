Erudite Ruby Distributed Database
I decided to write erudite because I was fascinated by Erlang’s EPMD
communications daemon.  I was thinking of a new open source project to work on,
and it seemed like a good idea to build a ragged right edge database that would
auto-shard, auto-migrate and auto-cluster.  I also needed for it to listen for
MySQL traffic and have a DSL for SQL which Ruby helps with.

I chose to write it in Ruby because I felt that Ruby’s dynamic nature would
make it easier to work with.

Features

    -Auto sharding
    -Auto data migration based on capacity and usage
    -Partial file storage
    -Self-healing
    -Auto-Discovery of new processes
